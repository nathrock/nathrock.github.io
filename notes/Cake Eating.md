# Cake Eating

A cake eater is endowed with a cake that never spoils. They choose a piece of cake, $c_t$, and the remaining size of the cake, $k_t$, to maximize present value lifetime utility, keeping in mind that the cake is finite. i.e.,

$$\max_{c_t, k_t} \sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta^j c_{t+j}$$

$$ c_t + k_t = k_{t-1}$$

where they start the day with cake $k_{t-1}$. 

## Solution

Plug the resource constraint into the objective function.
