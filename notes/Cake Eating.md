A cake eater is endowed with a cake that never spoils. They choose a piece of cake, $c_t$, to maximize present value lifetime utility, keeping in mind that the cake is finite. i.e.,

$$\max_{c_t} \sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta c_{t+j}$$
$$ c_t + k_t = k_{t-1}$$
where they start the day with cake $k_{t-1}$ and end the day with cake $k_t$.
