> This paper provides new insights into the business cycle mechanics of search and matching models. We develop a novel identification scheme based on the matching elasticity that allows these models to perfectly match a range of labor market moments. Our estimated linear model also matches several non-targeted moments including the Beveridge curve and the decomposition of inflows and outflows of unemployment. A structural decomposition reveals job separation rate shocks explain 40% of unemployment volatility. The nonlinear version of our model generates state-dependent dynamics that produce empirically consistent fluctuations in output growth uncertainty, 37% of which stem from separation rate shocks.
