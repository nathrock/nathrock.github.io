> The Cobb-Douglas matching function is ubiquitous in labor search and matching models, even though it imposes a constant matching elasticity that is inconsistent with recent empirical evidence. To examine the implications of this discrepancy, this paper first uses a general constant returns to scale matching function to derive conditions that determine how the cyclicality of the matching elasticity amplifies or dampens nonlinear labor market dynamics. It then shows that modest cyclical variation in the matching elasticity, in line with the recent estimates, generates large differences in higher-order moments and has significant effects on optimal policy.
